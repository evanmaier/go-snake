# This is Forest, the Go battlesnake
- Forest is written in Go and uses game tree search to find it's moves. 
- He is designed to play classic 4 player battlesnake.
- My goal when starting this project was to learn about Go, and try out some interesting game tree search algorithms.
- I have tried to avoid using heuristics to guide Forest, instead relying on game tree search as much as possible.
